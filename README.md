## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I made this guide to help starting developers help themselves to remember all about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I built this project to make sure I will have some notes to look back on whenever I need some help. This solves searching muliples websites and instead you can relate to the information shown. I have learnt many key ways to code using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. 


You can open the Chrome DevTools to randomly see what topic to study first. 
There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework.
Make sure to keep randomly selecting what to study so you eventually choose all of the topics.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
